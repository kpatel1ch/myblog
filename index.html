        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England, the eldest of the four children of Mary Lee
            Woods and Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike is a professor of ecology and climate change management. His
            parents were computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1.
            He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south-west London's Emanuel School from
            1969 to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975. <br>
            After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole,
            Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software
            for printers.

            Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he
            proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among
            researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.

            After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in
            Bournemouth, Dorset. He ran the company's technical side for three years. The project he worked on
            was a "real-time remote procedure call" which gave him experience in computer networking. In 1984, he
            returned to CERN as a fellow.</p>
